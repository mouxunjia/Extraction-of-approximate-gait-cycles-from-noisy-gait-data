# Extraction-of-approximate-gait-cycles-from-noisy-gait-data
A MATLAB Code to extract gait cycles, even when the data is very noisy and there is no periodicity in the gait cycles. 
This code is used to extract gait cycle chunks from data where the gait may not be periodic.
The code frequency domain analysis, to extract the gait cycle chunks.
